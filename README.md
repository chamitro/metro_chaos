## 🕹️ What is Metro Chaos?

Metro Chaos is a browser-based strategy game that puts you in the control room of an expanding subway network. Your goal is to keep the city moving by managing resources, balancing station loads, and expanding your fleet before the timer runs out or the system overflows.

## ⚔️ Multiplayer Challenge

The **Versus Mode** runs on a dedicated server. To keep the multiplayer experience smooth and the servers running, I maintain this infrastructure out of my own pocket.
