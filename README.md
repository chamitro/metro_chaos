**Playable Link:** [https://chamitro.github.io/metro\_chaos/](https://chamitro.github.io/metro_chaos/)

A metro management strategy game where you transport passengers, upgrade stations, and try not to let the system collapse into chaos!

Features:

\- 🚇 Story Mode - 20 progressively challenging levels

\- ⏱️ Survival Mode - Endless mode, see how long you can last

\- 🎮 Versus Mode - Online real-time multiplayer battles against friends or other players

\- 💰 Resource management and strategic upgrades

\- 🌐 Completely free, browser-based (no download needed)

How to play:

Click stations to send trains, transport passengers efficiently, earn money to upgrade, and complete objectives before time runs out. Simple to learn, challenging to master!

Multiplayer challenge:

The versus mode runs on a dedicated server that I'm maintaining out of pocket. If you enjoy the game and want to help keep the multiplayer servers running (and support future updates), there's an optional Ko-fi link in the game menu. Absolutely not required - the game is 100% free regardless! ☕

Would love to hear your feedback, whether it's bugs, feature requests, or just your high scores! What do you think could make it better?

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏
